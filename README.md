# Side Projects

Welcome to the Side Projects folder! This directory contains various personal projects that I and my Friends have been working on in my spare time.

Most of the projects here are written in Python, as it is my preferred programming language due to its simplicity and versatility. 
However, you will also find projects written in other languages as I enjoy exploring different technologies and expanding my skill set.

You will also find the Teaching Folder located at `/Teaching job`. This folder is dedicated to my job in ADoT while teaching young minds how to program.
